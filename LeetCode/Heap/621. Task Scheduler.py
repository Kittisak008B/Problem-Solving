# You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, 
# but there's a constraint: identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.
# â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.

# Example 1:
# Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
# Output: 8
# Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
# After completing task A, you must wait two cycles before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th cycle, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.

# Example 2:
# Input: tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1
# Output: 6
# Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.
# With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other task.

# There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n - 1. You are given a 2D array graph, 
# where graph[u] is an array of nodes that node u is adjacent to. More formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. 
# The graph has the following properties:
# There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).
# There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).
# If v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).
# The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such that there is no path between them.
# A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets A and B such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and a node in set B.
# Return true if and only if it is bipartite.

# Example 1:
# 0-----1
# |  \  |
# 3----2
# Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]
# Output: false
# Explanation: There is no way to partition the nodes into two independent sets such that every edge connects a node in one and a node in the other.

# Example 2:
# 0-----1
# |     |
# 3-----2
# Input: graph = [[1,3],[0,2],[1,3],[0,2]]
# Output: true
# Explanation: We can partition the nodes into two sets: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
 
# Constraints:
# graph.length == n
# 1 <= n <= 100
# 0 <= graph[u].length < n
# 0 <= graph[u][i] <= n - 1
# graph[u] does not contain u.
# All the values of graph[u] are unique.
# If graph[u] contains v, then graph[v] contains u.

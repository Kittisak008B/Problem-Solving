# There are n workers. You are given two integer arrays quality and wage where quality[i] is the quality of the ith worker and wage[i] is the minimum wage expectation for the ith worker.
# We want to hire exactly k workers to form a paid group. To hire a group of k workers, we must pay them according to the following rules:
# Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.
# In the group, each worker's pay must be directly proportional to their quality. This means if a workerâ€™s quality is double that of another worker in the group, then they must be paid twice as much as the other worker.
# Given the integer k, return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the above conditions. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

# Example 1:
# Input: quality = [10,20,5], wage = [70,50,30], k = 2
# Output: 105.00000
# Explanation: We pay 70 to 0th worker and 35 to 2nd worker.
  
# Example 2:
# Input: quality = [3,1,10,10,1], wage = [4,8,2,2,7], k = 3
# Output: 30.66667
# Explanation: We pay 4 to 0th worker, 13.33333 to 2nd and 3rd workers separately.
